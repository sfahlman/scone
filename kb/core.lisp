;;;; -------------------------------------------------------------------------
;;;; UPPER

;;; Load the KB file containing important upper-ontology structures that
;;; don't need to be in "bootstrap.lisp".  As a rule, the bootstrap file contains
;;; only those structures that Scone engine code has to refer to.

(require-kb "core-components/upper")

;;;; -------------------------------------------------------------------------
;;;; UNITS

;;; Load the KB file defining units, measurable qualities, measures, and
;;; quantities.

(require-kb "core-components/units")

;;;; SPACE MODEL

;;; The minimal space model that you would want for almost all "common sense"
;;; reasoning.

(require-kb "core-components/space-model")

;;;; -------------------------------------------------------------------------
;;;; TIME MODEL

;;; Scone's time model.  This is essential for reasoning about actions
;;; and events, for example.

(require-kb "core-components/time-model")

;;;; -------------------------------------------------------------------------
;;;; SIMPLE PHYSICS & CHEMISTRY

;;; Minimal intuitive physics and chemistry knowledge that you will usually
;;; want around for any "common sense" application.  For example, it knows that
;;; a physical object has mass.  For more specialized scientific/engineering
;;; applications you would load a much more detailed file on top of this one.

(require-kb "core-components/simple-physics")

;;;; -------------------------------------------------------------------------
;;;; SIMPLE BIOLOGY & MEDICINE

;;; This is meant to be the stuff that you will usually want around
;;; for almost any "common sense" application.  It knows about
;;; animals, plants, gender, parent/child relations, sickness, etc.
;;; For more specialized scientific/medical applictions you would load
;;; a much more detailed file on top of this one.

(require-kb "core-components/simple-biology")

;;;; ----------------------------------------------------------------------
;;;; INFORMATION, FILES, AND MESSAGES

;;; General knowledge about information that you would want around for
;;; almost any "common sense" application.  The Person model uses this
;;; heavily.

(require-kb "core-components/simple-information")

;;;; ----------------------------------------------------------------------
;;;; SOCIAL

;;; General knowledge about human organizations and social relationships that you would
;;; want around for almost any "common sense" application.

;;;; ASPECTS OF PERSON

;;; General knowledge about people that you would want around for
;;; almost any "common sense" application.

;;;; EPISODIC MEMORY

;;; General knowledge of events, actions, sequences, and plans.
