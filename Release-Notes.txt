Release Notes for the Scone Knowledge-Base System
Author: Scott E. Fahlman <sef@cs.cmu.edu>
===========================================================================
User-visible changes since v1.0.0:
===========================================================================
Eliminated all the "simple" prefixes in the core-components files,
and updated the core.lisp file to load the new names.  Some of these
files are indeed very minimal, but I don't want to be thinking about
how complex they have to be before we drop the "simple".  If some
files ultimately have a simple "core" version and a more complex
version for some class of applications, we can worry about appropriate
naming then.

Moved some upper-ontology stuff (e.g. the definition of {event}) from
episodic.lisp to upper-lisp, since other things will need to see these
elements.

Began consolidating some of Laleh's KB stuff from the
vehicle-maintenance domain into a new directory that is not (for now)
part of "core".  Began consolidating episodic stuff from Laleh and
Maria into episodic.lisp, and began adding some of my own
augmentations.

Remove *kb-logging-stream* and the functionality that supports it.
This continuous-logging facility was added during the RADAR project on
the theory that it made a continuously-learning system more robust
than occasional checkpointing.  But to the best of my knowledge it has
never been used, and keeping it all consistent has been a big extra
drag on engine development.

Modified IS-X-A-Y? and IS-X-EQ-Y? to return the proper second values,
as documented in the Scone User's Guide.  That is, if the answer is
:NO due to a violated split or an explicit NOT-EQ link, return that
split or link as the second value.  This is the item you should cancel
if you want to force the answer to be :YES.

NOTE: There's a known bug here.  It appears that NOT-EQ links are not placing
negation markers correctly.  This will be fixed soon.  I think that
IS-NOT-A negation is now working as intended.
