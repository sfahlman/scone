;;; optimized for performance first and for clarity second.  Code that
;;; builds or modifies the KB, or that does higher-level setup for
;;; marker ops, can be slower, so I have tried to optimize that for

(subsection "Definitions Related to Flag Bits")

;;; A flag is like a permanent marker-bit on an element.  Each
;;; flag-bit is assigned to some system-defined purpose -- these are
;;; not meant to be user-defined.

;;; There is a word full of flag-bits in each element, but we do not
;;; maintain a linked list of elements with a given flag.  This is a
;;; difference between markers and flags.

;;; One important use of flag bits is to record the type of each
;;; element in a way that can quickly be tested by boolean-mask
;;; operations.

;;; IMPLEMENTATION NOTE: The current version of Scone was developed
;;; for a 32-bit implementation of Common Lisp, so flags and markers
;;; are kept in two separate words at the start of each element.  Now
;;; that we have 64-bit machines running 64-bit Common Lisp
;;; impelementnations we can speed up the system by keeping all these
;;; bits in a single marker/flag word, and doing Boolean checks over
;;; both at the same time.  That's on the to-do list, but it's tricky
;;; to build this in such a way that the system runs either on 32-bit
;;; or 64-bit implementations.  So we may either burn our bridges and
;;; go to 64-bit always, or maintain two distinct Scone versions.

(section "Scone Elements")
;;; ***************************************************************************

;;; An element is the basic unit of knowledge in the Scone system.  An
;;; element is either a NODE, representing some individual, type, or
;;; entity, a LINK, representing the statement of a relation between two or
;;; more entities.  But a link has a built-in "handle node" representing
;;; the statement itself, and a node may have some "wires" that represent
;;; certain special relations with other nodes.  So every element has both
;;; a set of outgoing wires (PARENT, CONTEXT, A, B, and C) plus connection
;;; points for any number of incoming wires.

;;; NOTE: Speed in the inner loops is very important.  The natural thing,
;;; would be to implement ELEMENT as a CLOS class and all of the various
;;; element types as sub-classes.  In principle, the CLOS machinery in
;;; Common Lisp should be able to implement that very efficiently.
;;; However, CLOS implementations vary a lot and are inefficient in some
;;; Common Lisp implementations.  So for now we simply use use the same
;;; structure (a Common Lisp DEFSTRUCT) for every element, and use the flag
;;; bits to distinguish the element's type.

;;; NOTE: We could reorganize this to use separate subtypes of element
;;; for nodes and links, saving some space for the simpler node
;;; elements.  But the savings is small and this might actually slow
;;; down some of the scans.  Sometime I should run an experiment to
;;; explore the time/space tradeoff here, but a single element type
;;; will do for now.

;;; The SHOW function prints out the set in a human-readable form.  We
;;; don't want these functions to just stupidly print out thousands of
;;; elements unless the user explicitly asks for that.  So in general,
;;; these functions default to printing the first 100 elements in the
;;; requested set, with a notation indicating that there are more.

;;; The :N keyword argument, an integer, specifies the maximum number of
;;; elements to be printed.  The default value is 100.

;;; The :ALL keyword, followed by T, forces printing of *all* the selected
;;; elements.

;;; The :LAST keyword argument, an integer, says to print the last n
;;; selected elements instead of the first n.

;;; Normally you supply only one of :N, :ALL, or :LAST.

;;; The :HEADING keyword is a string to print at the start of the list.

(subsection "Internal Element Names and Namespaces")

;;; The syntax {iname} designates the internal name of a Scone element.

;;; If the open-curly-brace is immediately followed by a string, as in
;;; {"Santo Domingo"}, this designates a STRING element. If a
;;; string-element representing the identical string already exists,
;;; it will be returned and no new element will be created.

;;; Similarly, if the curly braces surround a Lisp number, function,
;;; or defstruct, we create the corresponding NUMBER or FUNCTION or
;;; STRUCT.  Again, an existing element with the same value may be
;;; returned instead.

;;; Otherwise, we check whether the named element already exists, and
;;; return it if so.  If the element doesn't yet exist, we create and
;;; return an ELEMENT-INAME structure.

;;; If the iname string contains a colon, the part before the colon
;;; identifies the namespace, while the part after the colon is the
;;; element's name, which must be unique within its namespace.

;;; If the string does not contain a colon, we assume that the namespace is
;;; the one specified by *namespace*, which is set up by the IN-NAMESPACE
;;; function.

;;; Internal names are matched in a case-insensitive way, but the case of
;;; the internal name string is preserved for more attractive printing.
;;; Exception: Internal names of STRING nodes are always case sensitive.
;;; Strings identifying namespaces are always case-insensitive.

;;; NOTE: For efficiency, the ELEMENT-INAME structure was defined earlier,

;;; Use normal compilation policy, where safety counts as much as speed.
(declaim (optimize (speed 1) (space 1) (safety 1)))

;;; Scone does not (yet) attempt to provide a serious natural-language
;;; interface.  We assume that some external package does the parsing of NL
;;; inputs and queries.  However, Scone does collect and make available a
;;; dictionary (hashtable) of natural-language words and phrases (Common
;;; Lisp strings) that refer directly to Scone elements.  It is convenient
;;; to include these natural-langauge labels in the same KB files that
;;; create the elements.

;;; For now, Scone supports only one natural language: English.  We hope to
;;; support additional natural languages in the future.  However, the
;;; choice of languages may be limited because few Common Lisp
;;; implementations support the full Unicode character set.

;;; The association from English strings to Scone elements is stored in the
;;; *ENGLISH-DICTIONARY* hash-table.

;;; For each association we also store a syntax tag, such as :NOUN or :ADJ.
;;; The idea is that an external NL front-end will do the parsing or
;;; part-of-speech assignment, and then will use the Scone dictionary to
;;; find one or more elements corresponding to the sting/tag combination.

;;; The syntax tags currently allowed are stored in the variable
;;; *LEGAL-SYNTAX-TAGS*.  The following tags are currently defined:

;;; :NOUN -- Either a common name or a proper name for the entities
;;; represented by the element.  "Clyde" or "elephant".

;;; :ADJ -- An adjective like "blue", which is associated with a type-node.
;;; Gramatically, you normally combine the adjective with some noun,
;;; perhaps obtained from some superior of the type-node in question.  So
;;; we would say "a blue object" rather than just "a blue".

;;; :ADJ-NOUN -- A word like "solid" that can be used either as a noun or
;;; as an adjective.

;;; :ROLE -- A word like "population" that designates a role under some
;;; type node.  Normally used with "of" or a possessive form like "India's".

;;; :INVERSE-ROLE -- Name given to the inverse of a role relation.  For
;;; example, if the role is "PARENT", the inverse-role may be "CHILD".  So
;;; if we are told that "X is the CHILD of Y", we can convert this to "Y is
;;; the PARENT of X".

;;; :RELATION -- A word like "employs" or "hates" that represents some
;;; relation that is not an of-role or possessive.

;;; :INVERSE-RELATION -- Name given to the inverse of a relation.  For
;;; example, if the relation is "TALLER THAN", the inverse-role may be
;;; "SHORTER THAN".  So if we are told that "X is taller than Y", we can
;;; conver this to "Y is shorter than X".

;;; :VERB -- A verb that may or may not be an action verb.

;;; :ADVERB --An adverb like "fast" which is associated with a type-node
;;; or relation
